# TeamManager

- Here I have a simple command line application that allows you to build an HTMl for members of your team using [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) with the help of the [Inquirer NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4#examples)
- Using this command line application you will be able to dynamically create an HTML to display information about members within your team.

## Installation

- Before you can run this application you will need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it installed.

## Usage Tutorial 

- Before I give you step by step instructions, watch this video. If you need further help after the video, follow the step by step instructions under the video.

- First, you will need to clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:JonathanGuhl/TeamManager.git` 
- Second, open your terminal or use the terminal within whatever IDE you use and `cd` into whatever file you stored the cloned repository in.
- Third, before you run the node commands you will need to type `npm install`. 
- Fourth, for the developers you can run `npm run test` to verify that all the tests are running as planned. 
- Fifth, in the command line input `node main.js` then proceed to answer the questions about adding members of your team. Feel free to add as many as you'd like. 
- After you have succesfully answered all of the questions, your HTML file will be created in your cloned repository within the 'Generated' folder under 'team.html'. 
- Open the file in your default browswer and watch the magic happen!
